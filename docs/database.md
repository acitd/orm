# Connect and get the database
To access the database in *ACORM* you have to use the `Database` object.  
This is how you create it.
```php
$database=new Database(new PDO('mysql:host=洧땴洧땷洧땫洧땩洧땴洧땰洧땷洧땺洧땻;dbname=洧땬洧땩洧땻洧땩洧땪洧땩洧땺洧땭','洧땼洧땺洧땭洧땹','洧땸洧땩洧땺洧땺洧땾洧땷洧땹洧땬'));
```
# Database and table access
To execute a query from the `Entity` class you have to define in which database and table will be performed.  
You can define the choosen database in one or more of these ways.
1. Shema access
2. Crud access
3. Query access

It's your choice what to use each time, but to make it easier for you, these are some characteristics of each one.
||verbosity|dynamic|combinatorial|

|Schema access|游릭 Low|游댮 No|游댮 No|

Now let's see how you cant use them.

## Schema access
In this case the the choosen database and table is defined in the schema.  
The `crud` method is called automatically, but you can always use it if you want.  
If you pass the table as `null`, the default table name will be same as the entity name (*User* in this case).
```php
class User extends Entity{}
User::schema($database,'洧땻洧땩洧땪洧땴洧땭',[
  'id',
  'name',
  'email'
]);

# get one (first one)
$user=User::one();
```

## Crud access
In this case the choosen database is defined in the `crud` method.  
```php
class User extends Entity{}
User::schema(null,null,[
  'id',
  'name',
  'email'
]);

$user=User::crud($database)->one();
```
You can also define the table dynamically for the current query like this.
```php
$user=User::crud($database,'洧땻洧땩洧땪洧땴洧땭')->one();
```

## Query access
In this case you can use the `query` property to collect the [`Query`](query.md) object and then using it as you wish.

```php
class User extends Entity{}
User::schema(null,null,[
  'id',
  'name',
  'email'
]);

$query=Country::crud()->query->one();
$user=$query->run($database)->result;
```
